The men in our protagonist's family possess the ability to travel backward in time, with limitations.
 This tool (and its rules) drives humor and heartbreak throughout the movie, 
 culminating in a final conversation between Tim and his father about the big secret to living with the gift. As Tim says,  "Part one of the two-part plan was that I should just get on with ordinary life, living it day by day, like anyone else.
 But then came part two of Dad's plan. He told me to live every day again almost exactly the same. 
The first time with all the tensions and worries that stop us noticing how sweet the world can be, but the second time noticing."
